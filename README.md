The goal of the work is to introduce changes into tea tasting as an experience and evaluate the results by using an Arduino-exclusive methodology. S/he also identifies the main objective that targets the implementation of a new approach to tea-tasting using technological support to develop an objective assessment. More explicitly, they entail data gathering to assess black tea and experimentation with the machines that incorporate sensors associated with Arduino based on Tea Test Tasting Terminology. In addition, this project aims to design several ML models such as Random Forest Classifier and Artificial Neural Network to identify if the sample is high-fired, and Convolutional Neural Networks-Mobilenetv2-Densenet 201 for classification of tastes of different tea quality according to the Tea Tasting Terminology. Another pivotal activity of the project is to create linear regression model for predicting the Brix (%) value in tea from the TDS in ppm thereof. Last but not the least; the project aims at studying patterns that might be associated with sugar-based adulteration in black tea based on different teas mixtures The overall approach is designed to provide a detailed and overall approach to understanding of the techniques that can be applied with regard to black tea quality and authenticity of taste.
